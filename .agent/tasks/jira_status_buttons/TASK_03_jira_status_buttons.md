title: Validate UX and document testing
phase: Phase 3 - Verification
---

## Goal

Manually verify the Jira-style status workflow and update documentation of testing performed.

## Steps

1. Trigger each status transition from within the dialog to confirm correct behavior and toasts.
2. Confirm the resolution dialog resets state after success or cancellation.
3. Spot-check that unauthorized users still see view-only messaging (requires role simulation if possible).
4. Run available project commands (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`) when feasible.
5. Record testing outcomes in the planâ€™s Progress section.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Manual checks confirm smooth UX without console errors.
- Dialog closes and resets appropriately after submission/cancellation.
- Testing notes are reflected in the plan.
